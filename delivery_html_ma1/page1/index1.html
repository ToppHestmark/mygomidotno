    I'm finding Nepal is a adventurous country to visit, among the highest peaks of the world is located there and plenty of places to go to be such a small country.
    I spent 6 weeks travelled the country in altogether. Started from kathmandu and ended in Kathmandu. Picture above were from Mardi Himal, located mid-west 
    of the country. I did the hike to the top in just two days, the trail easy guided and less crowded compared to Everest Base Camp.

    Travelling around the country is supercheap, cheap accomondations and food can be found everywhere. Just one of the few country that wont break my wallet.
    The food is great. I ate Dhal Bhat mostly of the time, which is very common among locals. This country have a diverse landscape, from south to north. Friendly 
    locals and charms everywhere that make me wanted to coming back.
