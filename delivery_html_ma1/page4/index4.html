    Vietnam is also one of my favourite country to go. Rich of history, food, culture and stunning landscapes. I been into this country 4 times and still 
    have not seen everything yet, the country streches from south coast nearby Cambodia to all the way to border of China. With great variation of natures
    and landscapes the country attract a lot of visitors. One can easily combine experience nature and cultures at the same time since the country is 
    huge and plenty of things to offer.

    When it comes to cost of living barely few country could measure with Vietnam. Super delicious food for a fraction of price compare to Europe, and the best 
    of all is definitely beer. I drank countless amount of beer during my time travelled in the coutry. Hopefully making my way back to this country very soon.
